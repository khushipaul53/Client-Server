findfile filename
 If the file filename is found in its file directory tree rooted at ~, the server must
return the filename, size(in bytes), and date created to the client and the
client prints the received information on its terminal.
 Note: if the file with the same name exists in multiple folders in the
directory tree rooted at ~, the server sends information pertaining to
the first successful search/match of filename
 Else the client prints “File not found”
